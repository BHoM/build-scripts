# BHoM Automated Build Scripts

The scripts contained in this repo help you clone, pull and build BHoM toolkits from source.

To set up and run on your local machine ensure you have reviewed and set the varibles in the Config.ps1 PowerShell script, including the Microsoft Visual Studio MSBuild.exe and the NuGet.exe paths
If you do not have Nuget.exe on your machine, it can be downloaded from https://www.nuget.org/downloads
